# SnowRunnerFix
 Fix for SnowRunner, relevant for the version from Microsoft Store | Xbox (for PC).
# Before launching SnowRunner, run this fix
 This fix helps to solve the problem of departure in the SnowRunner game, since the game conflicts with "explorer.exe". In short, the application automatically closes "explorer.exe" when you launch the game, and also launches if you quit.
 Let me know if other Xbox | Microsoft store games are not working stably with "explorer.exe", i will add it to this fix.

Download .exe file (if you don't want to build the project yourself)
- .exe file [Download](https://github.com/OneSpir1t/SnowRunnerFix/blob/b4a68f0242ce6c06afabcff6f845b9ac1e1788c4/SnowRunnerFix/bin/Release/SnowRunnerFix.exe)

# About Fix
This fix was made due to the error -1058406399, for which there is no information on the Internet, the only solution for me was to create this application. Besides, when I started using the fix, I didn't have a single mistake yet.

# P.S.
 The visual part is presented in the form of two buttons that open and close "explorer.exe" forcibly.
