# SnowRunnerFix
 Fix for SnowRunner
# Before launching SnowRunner, run this fix
 This fix helps to solve the problem of departure in the SnowRunner game, since the game conflicts with "explorer.exe". In short, the application automatically closes "explorer.exe" when you launch the game, and also launches if you quit.
